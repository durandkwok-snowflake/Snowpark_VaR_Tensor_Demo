# Snowpark_VaR_Tensor_Demo

Snowpark allows you to write Python, Scala, or Java code to interact with Snowflake data and perform data processing inside the Snowflake database. This enables you to run computations and data transformations closer to the data, reducing the need for moving data between different systems. In this demo, we'll use Snowflake's native notebook to showcase how we can run VaR using Monte Carlo Simulation.

In this introduction, we'll cover:
1. **What is VaR?**
2. **Why Snowpark for VaR?**
3. **Key steps for implementing VaR using Snowpark**
